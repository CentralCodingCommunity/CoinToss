CoinToss
========

The creation of this program has a little story. I was in math class and a classmate was playing around with the probability simulator on his TI Calculator. He was trying to do as many coin tosses as he could, until finally he reached 9999, which was the limit of tosses for the simulator. So I decided that I would create this, which allows you to do more than that, specifically 9223372036854765808 more trials than that.
